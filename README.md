Advanced Statistical Modeling

Course Objectives:
To learn advanced statistical modeling. Introduces methods, theory and applications of modern statistical models from linear  models to generalized hierarchical linear models, including hierarchical logistic and hierarchical count regression models. Topics includes estimation, residual diagnostics, goodness of fit, transformations, and various strategies for variable selection and model comparison. Examples will be demonstrated using statistical programming language R.

Course Materials:
We will cover parts of Chapters 1-15 and 20 of Data Analysis Using Regression and Multilevel/Hierarchical Models by Andrew Gelman and Jennifer Hill.
